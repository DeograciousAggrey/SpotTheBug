        ANALYZING THE SMART CONTRACT
 Upon inspecting the BabyCommitment smart contract, it is obvious that the contract implements an integer commitment scheme which is a form of secret commit-reveal scheme. 
 Such schemes are used for example in DARK polynomial commitments, which are used in some Zero-knowledge proofs as supersonic.

 *For the sake of the challenge the commitment scheme implememnted in the contract omits random number inclusion in commitment calculation.
 *Also, we can ignore the fcat that the commitments's secret number can be seen in the blockchain.


        FINDING THE GROUP ORDER
BabyCommitment smart contract implements an integer commitment with an unknown order group.
To further exploit this scheme, we need to consider the characteristics of the group order utilised in the smart contract.
Group order being unknown is the crucial part in determining the security of the scheme.

If it was chosen a finite group with prime modulus (Z/nZ)* then the order could be easily calculated via the Euler totient function: Ï†(n) = n - 1.
