        ANALYZING THE SMART CONTRACT
 Upon inspecting the BabyCommitment smart contract, it is obvious that the contract implements an integer commitment scheme which is a form of secret commit-reveal scheme. 
 Such schemes are used for example in DARK polynomial commitments, which are used in some Zero-knowledge proofs as supersonic.

 *For the sake of the challenge the commitment scheme implememnted in the contract omits random number inclusion in commitment calculation.
 *Also, we can ignore the fcat that the commitments's secret number can be seen in the blockchain.
